    "text": "The Language, Cognition, and Computation Lab uses large language models as “model organisms” to study human cognition. We combine methods from cognitive science, linguistics, and AI to understand how meaning is represented and processed—in both minds and machines.\n\n\nTheory of Mind in Language Models\nDo LLMs represent mental states, or just predict text?\n\nWe investigate whether and how language models develop theory of mind capabilities through false belief tasks, activation patching experiments, and analysis of attention patterns during social reasoning. Our work examines multiple open-weight models to understand the mechanisms underlying apparent mental state reasoning and whether these systems implement human-like representations or alternative computational strategies.\nSelected papers:\n\nTrott, S., Jones, C., Chang, T., Michaelov, J., & Bergen, B.

But meaning is often dynamically modulated in different contexts. I’ve been using LLMs to explore an alternative account, in which word meanings are viewed as attractors in a continuous state-space, and then asking whether there is evidence for category boundaries atop this continuous space.\nSelected papers:\n\nRivière, P., & Trott, S.
