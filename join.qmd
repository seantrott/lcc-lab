Thank you for your interest in joining the lab! 

## Prospective Graduate Students

I am recruiting graduate students. If you're interested in working with me, please apply through the [Psychology PhD program at Rutgers University–Newark](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/graduate-program-psychology). 

If you have questions about the lab or want to discuss fit before applying, you're welcome to reach out by email.

## Postdocs

I don't currently have funding for postdoctoral positions, but if you're interested in applying for external funding to work in the lab, I'd be happy to discuss possibilities so we could apply for a grant together.
